5. Data Warehouse Migration
	* Transfer the data warehouse to a cloud service. Design a frontend to enable users to extract useful information.
6. Optimizing Clinical Trials Recruitment Through a Mobile App
	* Optimizing identification of study candidates and promoting awareness of ongoing clinical trials amongst physicians and trainees. 


Projects Mentored (2020)
======
1. Software for Detection of Cancer Cells in Pathology Images Using Smart Phones
	* Develop a system to generate a high-resolution image of a pathology slide for diagnostic-use by an oncologist.
2. Apple Watch App for SEARCH Study
	* Assist collecting real-time follow-up data through the creation of an app for the Apple Smart Watch. Facilitate Vancouver Stroke Program (VSP) to move from telephone follow-ups to a more automated method of data collection. 
3. Capturing and Synthesizing UBC’s Tree Inventory for Biodiversity Enhancement
	* Build a tree inventory system for the University of British Columbia (UBC) Social Ecological Economic Development Studies (SEEDS) sustainability program and UBC Campus and Community Planning.

Projects Mentored (2021)
======
1. Monitor Nature with AI Automatic Change Detection
	* Create a mobile application prototype and a working back-end solution for detecting one type of natural change: deforestation changes, which can prove the use-case of nature change detection.
2. Smart Analytics Dashboard
	* Data analytics dashboard that can help restaurants visualize their revenue and customer review data. Furthermore, the optional functionality of determining customer sentiment from reviews, forecasting revenue, and providing recommendations for next best actions to increase customer sentiment or revenue.
