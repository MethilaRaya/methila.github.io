Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Thesis: Computational Models for Genomic Representations), The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2022 (expected)
* M.A.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Thesis: A hybrid precoding and signal detection framework for future wireless systems), The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2022
* B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Enginnering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, 2017 

Work experience
======
* Jan 2019 - Current: Ph.D. Research Assistant
  * The University of British Columbia 
  * Work: Building epigenomic and Hi-C representations using sequential and graphical deep learning
    models. These representations are useful for pan-celltype classification of genomic
    phenomena, in-silico mutagenesis, and inference of 3D chromatin structure.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Maxwell Libbrecht and Prof. Vijay Bhargava

* May 2018 - Sep 2018: Machine Learning Intern
  * Skycope Technologies
  * Work: Built a deep learning framework for signal detection which outperformed traditional signal
    processing methods. This signal detection framework helped Skycope detect narrow
    band drone signals in a wideband capture and block them.
  * Supervisor: Hamidreza Boostanimehr

* Sep 2017 - Dec 2018: M.A.Sc. Research Assistant
  * The University of British Columbia
  * Work: Adopted deep learning frameworks for wireless signal detection and developed hybrid
    precoding schemes for sequential wireless data.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Vijay Bhargava
