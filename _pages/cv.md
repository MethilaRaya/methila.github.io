Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (<span style="color:#2C4381">Thesis: Machine Learning Strategies for Genomic Representations)</span>, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Jan 2023 (expected)
* M.A.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2018
* B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Enginnering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, 2017 

Work experience
======
* ## Ph.D. Candidate, The University of British Columbia <span style="color:#2C4381">(Jan 2019 - Current)</span> 
  * My thesis studies learning strategies that can design representations for the <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenome</u></a> and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>chromatin structure</u></a>
  * These representations are useful for a variety of tasks like pan-celltype element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, inference of 3D chromatin structure, and in-silico modifications
  * The software for my research is written in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The software packages resulting from this work are available on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbdsouza"><u>GitHub</u></a>
  * **Supervisor**: Prof. Maxwell Libbrecht (<a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>) and Prof. Vijay Bhargava

* ## Machine Learning Intern, <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a> <span style="color:#2C4381">(Jan 2019 - Current)</span> 
  * I designed proteins using sequence and structure based Machine Learning, protein folding tools, and protein language models
  * **Manager**: Abhishek Mukopadhyay

* ## Machine Learning Intern, Skycope Technologies <span style="color:#2C4381"> (May 2018 - Sep 2018)</span>
  * Built Skycope's data and machine learning infrastructure 
  * Set up Skycope's database server and backend MySQL software for data extraction and manipulation 
  * Modified Faster-RCNN, an existing object detection framework, to successfully (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>detect and locate drone signals in the spectrogram</u></a>)
  * Integrated ML software into Skycope's existing software stack 
  * Skycope is now using this as their flagship service in their automatic drone detection software
  * **Supervisor**: Hamidreza Boostanimehr

* ## M.A.Sc. Research Assistant, The University of British Columbia <span style="color:#2C4381"> (Sep 2017 - Dec 2018)</span>
  * Adopted deep learning frameworks for signal detection and developed hybrid precoding schemes for sequential data
  * Used Python, PyTorch, and CUDA for deep learning
  * **Supervisor**: Prof. Vijay Bhargava

Service 
======
* Joint-Secretary at Autism Society of Udupi (ASU)
  * ASU is a non-profit organisation in Udupi, India, that aims to create awareness about Autism among parents, teachers, health professionals, students, general public and all the stakeholders so that early diagnosis and early intervention could give the child maximum benefits
  * Currently we are working alongside primary schools to educate teachers about autism. Partnering with various organisations working towards similar causes 
* Mentor at Climate Hub, UBC
  * The UBC Climate Hub aims to connect university and community stakeholders to take bold climate action for a just and equitable future
  * I worked with undergraduate students to find interdisciplinary approaches that contribute to climate awareness
* Mentor at iGEM, UBC
  * The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) Competition aims to produce organisms with unusual properties to tackle modern problems using synthetic biology
  * I worked with undergraduate students to design a transcription-based biosensor that detects levels of saxitoxin, a toxin responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans
* Volunteer at Lets Talk Science and Geneskool, Genome BC
  * Mentored high school students to inculcate in them aptitude and curiosity towards science
  * Conducted workshops on the basics of genetics, traits and phenotypes for elementary grade students
