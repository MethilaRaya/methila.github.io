Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Thesis: Computational Models for Genomic Representations), The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2022 (expected)
* M.A.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Thesis: A hybrid precoding and signal detection framework for future wireless systems), The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2022
* B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Enginnering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, 2017 

Work experience
======
* ## Ph.D. Research Assistant ##, The University of British Columbia (Jan 2019 - Current) 
  * **Work**: Building epigenomic and Hi-C representations using sequential and graphical deep learning
    models. These representations are useful for pan-celltype classification of genomic
    phenomena, in-silico mutagenesis, and inference of 3D chromatin structure.
  * **Supervisor**: Prof. Maxwell Libbrecht and Prof. Vijay Bhargava

* ## Machine Learning Intern ##, Skycope Technologies (May 2018 - Sep 2018)
  * **Work**: Built a deep learning framework for signal detection which outperformed traditional signal
    processing methods. This signal detection framework helped Skycope detect narrow
    band drone signals in a wideband capture and block them.
  * **Supervisor**: Hamidreza Boostanimehr

* ## M.A.Sc. Research Assistant ##, The University of British Columbia (Sep 2017 - Dec 2018)
  * **Work**: Adopted deep learning frameworks for wireless signal detection and developed hybrid
    precoding schemes for sequential wireless data.
  * **Supervisor**: Prof. Vijay Bhargava

Service 
======
* Joint-Secretary at Autism Society of Udupi (ASU)
  * ASU is a non-profit organisation in Udupi, India, that aims to create awareness about Autism among parents, teachers, health professionals, students, general public and all the stakeholders so that early diagnosis and early intervention could give the child maximum benefits. 
* Mentor at Climate Hub, UBC
  * Worked with undergraduate students to find interdisciplinary climate solutions and contribute to climate awareness.
* Mentor at iGEM, UBC
  * Worked with undergraduate students to develop synthetic biology solutions.
* Volunteer at Lets Talk Science
  * Mentoring high school students to inculcate in them aptitude and curiosity towards science.
* Volunteer at Geneskool, Genome BC
  * Conducted workshops on the basics of genetics, traits and phenotypes for elementary grade students.
