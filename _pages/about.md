I am a final year Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia working on computational genomics. I am currently looking for internship/part time contract roles (with a possibility for extension) in Computational Biology, Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Development.

I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their data and machine learning infrastructure and integrate it into their existing software stack. I was responsible for setting up their database server and backend MySQL software for data extraction and manipulation. Skycope wanted to automatically detect narrowband drone signals in a wideband capture. In order to achieve this, I (along with a fellow intern) modified Faster-RCNN, an existing object detection framework, to successfully detect and locate drone signals in the spectrogram (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publication/frcnn"><u>published work</u></a>). Skycope is now using this as their flagship service in their automatic drone detection software.

After my M.A.Sc I moved on to jointly work with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University for my Ph.D. At <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a> we are currently working on building representations for the genome. Representation Learning has been quite successful in a variety of settings in computer science, and we believe that genomic representations will have a similar impact on computational genomics in the coming decade. My thesis aims to unify recurrent and graph neural networks for learning representations of epigenomic signals (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publication/epilstm"><u>published work</u></a>) and 3D genome organization (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publication/hiclstm"><u>published work</u></a>). The representations from our models are useful for a variety of tasks like element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, and in-silico modifications. The software for my research is written mostly in Python using PyTorch and CUDA extensively. The software packages resulting from this work are avaialale on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbdsouza"><u>GitHub</u></a>. We are working on cloud based deployment using GCP/AWS for future releases.
