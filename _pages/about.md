Hi, welcome to my site!

I am a final year Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia working on computational genomics. I am currently looking for full-time roles in Computational Biology, Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Development. If you're looking for candidates and think I would be a good fit, do get in touch.  

I am currently a Protein Design Intern at Gandeeva Therapeutics, where I am using sequence and structure based Machine Learning to design therapeutic proetins. 

For my Ph.D., I work with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, we are currently working on building representations for the genome. Representation Learning has been quite successful in a variety of settings in computer science, and we believe that genomic representations will have a similar impact on computational genomics in the coming decade. My thesis works towards the mechanistic interpretation of (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenomic representations</u></a>) and (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>3D genome organization</u></a>). The representations from our models are useful for a variety of tasks like pan-celltype element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, inference of 3D chromatin structure, and in-silico modifications. The software for my research is mostly written in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The software packages resulting from this work are available on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbdsouza"><u>GitHub</u></a>. 

Before my Ph.D., I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their data and machine learning infrastructure and integrate it into their existing software stack. I was responsible for setting up their database server and backend. Skycope wanted to automatically detect narrowband drone signals in a wideband capture. In order to achieve this, I modified Faster-RCNN, an existing object detection framework, to successfully detect and locate drone signals in the spectrogram (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>signal detection</u></a>). Skycope is now using this as their flagship service in their automatic drone detection software.

Apart from my research, I spend most of my time thinking about and engaging in the following:
1. Creating support systems for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
2. Things related to climate change, including (a) physics and ML based climate modeling, (b) international collaboration and climate ploicy, (c) climate technolgies like CCS, DAC, and (d) alternative economic systems for the future. 
3. I'm very interested in (d) and I'm currently reading about/looking into multi-agent systems simulations that can give insight into alternative economic theories and global co-operation (<a href="https://www.ai4climatecoop.org/"><u>climate co-operation</u></a>). 

You can reach out to me if you want to discuss any of the above, or any other ideas you may find interesting.
