Hi, welcome to my site!

I am a final year Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia working on computational genomics. I am currently looking for full-time roles in Computational Biology, Machine Learning, and Data Science. If you're looking for candidates and think I would be a good fit, do get in touch.  

I am currently a Protein Design Intern at <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a>, where I am using sequence and structure based Machine Learning to design proteins. 

For my Ph.D., I work with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, we are currently working on building representations for the genome. Representation Learning has been quite successful in a variety of settings in computer science, and we believe that genomic representations will have a similar impact on computational genomics in the coming decade. My thesis works towards the mechanistic interpretation of (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenomic representations</u></a>) and (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>3D genome organization</u></a>). The representations from our models are useful for a variety of tasks like pan-celltype element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, inference of 3D chromatin structure, and in-silico modifications. The software for my research is mostly written in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The software packages resulting from this work are available on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbdsouza"><u>GitHub</u></a>. 

Before my Ph.D., I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their data and machine learning infrastructure which they are now using as a flagship service in their automatic drone detection software.

Apart from my research, I spend most of my time thinking about and engaging in isues related to climate change, including (a) <a href="https://www.ai4climatecoop.org/"><u>international collaboration on climate ploicy using AI</u></a>, (b) computational protein/enzyme engineering that can enhance carbon sequestration, and (c) designing alternative economic systems for the future. 

You can reach out to me if you want to discuss any of the above, or any other ideas you may find interesting.
