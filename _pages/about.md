I am a final year Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia working on computational genomics. I am currently looking for internships/part time contract roles (with a possibility of extension) in Computational Biology, Global Priorities Research, Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Development.

I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their data and machine learning infrastructure and integrate it into their existing software stack. I was responsible for setting up their database server and backend MySQL software for data extraction and manipulation. Skycope wanted to automatically detect narrowband drone signals in a wideband capture. In order to achieve this, I (along with a fellow intern) modified Faster-RCNN, an existing object detection framework, to successfully detect and locate drone signals in the spectrogram (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>published work</u></a>). Skycope is now using this as their flagship service in their automatic drone detection software.

After my M.A.Sc, I moved on to work with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University for my Ph.D, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, we are currently working on building representations for the genome. Representation Learning has been quite successful in a variety of settings in computer science, and we believe that genomic representations will have a similar impact on computational genomics in the coming decade. My thesis aims to unify recurrent and graph neural networks for learning representations of epigenomic signals (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>published work</u></a>) and 3D genome organization (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>submitted work</u></a>). The representations from our models are useful for a variety of tasks like pan-celltype element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, inference of 3D chromatin structure, and in-silico modifications. The software for my research is mostly written in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The software packages resulting from this work are available on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbdsouza"><u>GitHub</u></a>. We are working on cloud based deployment using GCP/AWS for future releases. 

Apart from my research, I spend most of my time thinking about and engaging in the following:
1. Creating support systems for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
2. Everything related to climate change, including (a) physics and ML based climate modeling, (b) international collaboration and climate ploicy, (c) climate technolgies like CCS, DAC, and (d) alternative economic systems for the future. I'm very interested in (d) and I'm currently reading about/looking into multi-agent systems simulations that can give insight into alternative economic theories by optimizing for metrics other than GDP
3. Molecular representation learning for individual nulceotide molecules. Graph learning for drug discovery
4. Astrophysics and Astrobiology 
5. Reading

You can reach out to me if you want to discuss or work together on any of the above, and any book/article recommendations you may have are always welcome.
